Kairos is designed to quickly locate open food restaurants nearby your current location. This app removes the effort of searching for the store's hours and location. This app with built using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Google Maps API and the Google Places API. I am currently in the process of converting the Kairos into a mobile app.
